# `tracing` example

This example shows how to use OpenTelemetry and the OpenTelemetry Application Insights exporter with [`tracing`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing).

Note: Because this relies on `tracing-opentelemetry`, which also has a dependency on `opentelemetry` itself, this example does not use the latest master version of `opentelemetry-application-insights`.
